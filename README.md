# Customer's Willingness to Wait

## Abstract

A model to predict the number of days a customer is willing to wait for a specific SKU based on historical data that will help companies better anticipate customer needs by stocking units for which willingness to wait is low. The model will eventually help in a company’s aim to achieve SKU rationalization on sales due to lack of inventory. The willingness to wait for an SKU is dependent on multiple factors like part type, customer requirement and urgency, delivery time to the closest store. Hence, the analysis needs to be done at an SKU level for a cluster of stores using survival analysis tracking the customer drop-off for products. Hence, we predict the time a customer is willing to wait for a specific SKU using survival and regression concepts in Python, R and SAS.
